   <body>
     <p>Hello , may you be having a great day at the time your read this. </p>
     

<p>
I am a 33 yeard old student  taking Math and English classes prep 

classes to start  The Computer Science Bachelor's with a minor in  Communications in the 

fall of this year, I finished a three month Paralegal internship with a Law Firm in Madrona at 

the end of 2018 and am taking independent studies in Economics , HTML , CSS , Javascript 

, Java ,C, C++ , C## , Operating Systems and Assembly Language </p>

<p> I also have been  accepted to fulfill an intership starting in June of this year and 

ending December of this year with a retired and accomplished Cybersecurity Analyst and 

Engineer who owns a PC repair shop where I will learn how to make home and business 

system networks, do computer tune-ups , make High End Pc Workstations and Gamings 

Systems from scratch among other things </p>

<p> I have been accepted to start working for Nintendo as a Consumer Service 

Representative where my duties will be to learn how to set up a wireless network and 

teach consumers how to use it , provide technical assistance to user experiencing problems 

with the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection and Virtual Console , troubleshoot escalated hardware 

and software technical problems among simpler tasks like collecting documents and 

reserching technical problems to develop solutions and resources for the Nintendo 

Consumer Service department .</p>


<p>
I start on the 22nd of January and even though the position pays really really well as it is 

the lowest of the positions that require above the average  computer understanding , being 

it below that of Junior Developer , I don't have an income between now and the 22nd of 

January , that's why I am humbly offering to make your day easier, better and more 

enjoyable by picking you up and dropping you off at The Airport , and picking you up at 

Sea-Tac and drop your off in Yakima or Bellingham and hourly  in exchange for voluntary 

donations that will save you money if you were to take a Lyft , Uber or hire a Limo/Town 

Car Service 

      </p>

<p> My Airport drop off suggested donation is just $25.00 , less than  Uber , Lyft and a 

Limo/Town Car Service , but with a personalized service , considering that the average 

price  you will pay for an Uber and Lyft to the airport will be $40.00 dollars minimum  my  

$25.00 suggested donation  is 37.5% less , and that is when you pay them $40.00 , 

sometimes like at  peak hour times with Uber and Lyft you pay more , and it gets 

better:</p>

<p>
The average price for an airport pick up to anywhere in Seattle with a Town Car/Limo 

service is $75.00 and they wait for you only 1 hour , after which they start charging you 

wait time ,  my Airport pick up suggested donation is just $50.00 for a 120 minute wait, 

that's right ,  that is  $25.00 and 33% less than with Town Car/Limos! , the average trip to 

Yakima with Town Car/Limos is $450.00 , my suggested donation is a flat 300.00 , $150.00 

and 33.33% less ! , the average trip to Bellingham with  Town Car/Limos is $350.00 , my 

suggested donation is a flat 235.00 , $115.00 and 32.85% less!, the average hourly rate of 

a Town Car /Limo service when you need them by the hour is $60.00 to $80.00 bucks , my 

suggested donation  is 35 ! , $25.00 to $45 bucks and  41.66% to 56.25% less !.

body and mind when you get off an airplane and then , on top <br>

hurrying you up and rush you ! , not a pleasant experience AT ALL!,<br>
my suggested donation is just  $10.00 bucks extra in exchange for <br>
Town Car/Limo  treatment without paying their price and literally <br>

With me , you can have peace of mind right at the moment<br>

5.- HOURLY <br>
---------<br>

<br>
<br>

WAIT TIME:<br>
-----------<br>
Suggested Donation: Only 1 small US Dollar per minute.
<p>
Uber , Lyft and Town Car/Limos charge $0.75 cents<br>
per minute.</p>

<p>
Due to financial circumstances , this is the only place where <br>
my suggest a donation  has to be more than Uber , Lyft and  <br>
Town Car/Limo Services .<br>
My suggested donations are extremely generous  and my wait <br>
times so big in comparison with theirs.<br>


<p> With Town Car/Limos you are way more likely to hit wait time<br>
quicker than with I , with such big wait times , with me , <br>
something would need to delay your flight a waaay lot for  <br>
you to hit wait time AT ALL , believe me , it doesn't take a lot <br>
to hit wait time with Town Car/Limos and heed me here, <br>
hitting wait time quick at $0.75 cents a minute and your flight <br>
delay makes you be at your driver's presence 2 hours late , you <br>
are already at the $135.00 bucks mark and that is without counting <br>
the time it will take you to get to the car from where your driver is at , <br>
and that is without counting the amount of time your driver will take to <br>
get to your destination , all of that is an extra $0.75 cents a minute<br>
above the $135.oo bucks mark at 2 hours of forced lateness </p>

<p> 120 minutes  for free on Airport pick ups is a big bargain ,<br>
Town Car/Limos only give you 1 hour  on Airport Pick ups, <br>
Uber and Lyft only give you 2 minute and 30  seconds<br>
on City pick ups before they start charging you wait time ,  <br>
my complimentary 15 minutes on City pick ups is a big bargain.</p>

<p>To schedule me  scroll down to the bottom of the page, <br>
     you will  see the contact info below the Disclaimer Notice<br>
     at the bottom of the page, by scheduling me you agree to the <br>
