                <p>Hello , my name is Kaiser Santosvictorious , bar manager of this pub and I am going to tell you a 
                    little bit about our concept and for that I have to tell you a little 
                    bit about the roots of our foundation .</p>
                    
                    <p>Mediterranean , Germanic and peoples of the British Isles , in that order, were the 
                    first Europeans to have contact with India and as the saying goes , 
                    the rest is history.</p>
                    
                    <p>Out of all , the Greeks and Romans were the first Europeans to have contact
                    with India , Greek philosophers and Indian philosophers exchanged
                    ideas and this Greco-Indian philosophy link is well documented.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Romans under their first Emperor , Augustus Caesar were the<br>
                    ones to introduce the magic of India  to Europe , exposing them to<br>
                    spices , textiles , mathematical advances , art from India .</p>
                    
                    <p>Swords were invented by Indians from Damascus and due to the fact <br>
                    that the  Romans held Indians in great esteem and cultivated excellent <br>
                    relationships with them , they were chosen as their biggest trading <br>
                    European partners for centuries , this allowed the Romans to have <br>
                    access to the many mathematical , engineering , architectural , <br>
                    chemical , metalurgical discoveries Indians made and this in turn<br>
                    allowed the  Romans  for centuries to have an edge over all European <br>
                    peoples , the Vikings , The Gauls , The Celts .</p>
                    
                    <p>The first war sword is The Roman sword , which is a modification of the<br>
                    Damascus sword  , the rest of European peoples started making their<br>
                    own sword but for a long time nobody could compete with Roman swords , 
                    their secret : Indian swordsmiths .</p>
                    
                    <p>Romans took Indian swordsmiths to live at their capital  and make <br>
                    swords to their specifiations , the secret of Indian sowrdsmiths ? :<br>
                     Damascus steel .</p>
                    
                    <p>Indians from Damascus were the first recorded people to discovered <br>
                    how to process steel into usable tools and weapons and did so long <br>
                    before Europeans did .</p>
                    
                    <p>For a long time no European people was able to tell that Roman swords<br>
                    were made of steel , and specifically , Damascus steel , the combination<br>
                    of Damascus steel with the mathematical , chemical and engineering<br>
                    skill of Swrodsmiths from Damascus gave Rome weaponry advantage for 
                    a longtime , as the rest of Europeans made their swords with iron , <br>
                    an inflexible and easily corruptible metal and they thought that<br>
                    Romans were simply making iron take a certain texture by some<br>
                    process , consequently they spent in their ignorance a long time<br>
                    treating iron to be "Roman iron" , this was of course , impossible <br>
                    and Romans laughed at the rest of Europeans for this for a long time  .</p>
                    
                    <p>Once Germanic , Scandinavian and British peoples learned about<br>
                    the Roman secret , India , they started expeditions of their own there , <br>
                    but for a long time Rome and all Mediterranean Europeans enjoyed the favor of
                    Indians and their knowledge of chemistry , mathematics , spices and metalurgy
                    went to them until England conquered India and appropriated to himself
                    all that .</p>
                    
                    <p>Many alcoholic drinks we consume nowadays started as elixirs to cure maladies and
                    here is where India plays a very important role in the culture of every single
                    European group that existed and exists to this day , for without India , 
                    the alcoholic drinks that European Kings , Queens and peasants enjoyed
                    would never had existed , why ? , take a look:</p>
                    
                    <p>Indian Licorice ,  used for centuries in Germany to make digestifs of which the most popular 
                    modern day descendant is Jagermaiser, pomegranate , used for centuries in Eastern Europe to make
                    one of their traditional spirits : pomegranate wine , star anice , used for centuries in Italy 
                    for the making of liqueur Galliano , star anise has been used for centuries as well by the
                    Germanic peoples of modern day Switzerland to make our beloved  ... absinthe ! , just in these examples you can see
                    that some of the most European of European liqueurs and digestifs are possible thanks to India , 
                    India even made a realtively recent contribution to the existence of Navy Strength gin and Indian 
                    Pale Ale beer by having British sailors and businessmen alter the consistency of their gin 
                    and beer in India when they colonized it .</p>

                   
                    
                    <p>India has , since Europeans have been able to travel , made an impact in to the  most vital
                        aspects of the life European peoples  , their food , their drinking , their mathematics  , weaponry
                        and architectural knowledge , and at Kaiser' Elixir Room we focus on bringing to you original recipies <br>
                    of Indo-European origin , we also include in our menu delicious cocktails<br>

                    a truly intenational cocktail experience with  Indo-European  roots .</p>

                        taking Math and English classes in preparation for the Computer Science Bachelors with the intention to
